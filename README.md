## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Navigate the slider using either their mouse/trackpad or keyboard

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The biggest thing I learned with this project is how to create an infinite image carousel using JavaScript. I've never made anything like that before, so it was a big deal to have an opportunity to learn how to make one.

I also learned more about dealing with overflow, since I had to make the row of images for the carousel cut off at the edge of the screen. I had some difficulty with it, but I figured out that by setting the section to max-width: 100%; and setting overflow-x: hidden; that I could cut it off. That was very helpful for me. 

This is only the second Junior level project that I've completed, so the layout was a bit more complicated than I'm used to. I was really intimidated by the grid section but in actuality I didn't have any problem with it at all. It's good to see that I've improved in my grid skills, because usually I have some trouble with it.

### Continued development

I had a lot of trouble with making the image carousel responsive, and in the end I never did figure it out. I got it to work smoothly in the mobile version, but I couldn't figure out how to make the JavaScript translate the images smoothly with the larger pictures. All the methods I tried that I found online didn't seem to work. So the main thing I want to learn from this project is how to make JavaScript dependent on the size of the screen. 

I also am going to continue working on Junior level projects to improve my skills with more complex layouts and JavaScript techniques.
